## Description
Smartbil by SaucyCorp is more than just a car. It's an experience. 

Smartbil Can be conotrolled in multiple ways, which leads to a higher degree of accesibility. As of the latest release, the car can be controlled by: 
- Keyboard
- Website
- Joystick
- Discord bot

Smartbil currently hosts two environments, a racing map where you can compete with your friends' times, and a city map where you can relax and drive the car.
These maps were developed using pre-made and custom made models.

Smartbil is a multi tiered system with both an emulator and a website. The website recieves input through a listener and sends it to a central server based in Frankfurt, Germany. The central server then creates a new emulator instance and simulates these inputs. It then proceeds to return a camera feed of the changes happening.

## Justification
Primarily used as a business tool to display the capabilities and limitations of the Smartcar library, this can also be used to showcase the capabilities of the emualtor and the software behind it. It also showcases how the software, library and emulator can be accessed and controlled using external environments.
It also demonstrates the usage of the sensors, primary to the development of smarter cars and automatic driving services.

There is an element of fun and games within the (CAR NAME) program, however. Featuring two maps upon release, users have a choice of "free play" where they explore a medium sized city with all sorts of stunning scenery and a race map where the user races against the clock in a high intensity race with multiple choices to make that impact the time taken. These map choices tests the library in two contrasting scenarios, which will hopefully lead to the development of a more flexible, relaible library.

This development process also explores how flexible and compatible the library really is, leading to a better development of the library itself by placing it in a realistic practical scenario instead of a vaccuum.
